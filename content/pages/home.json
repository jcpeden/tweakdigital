They've extended my contract out until November 2020 so I won't be looking for a new role until September at the earliest.\n\nIn the meantime, I created this site because my old one was a pretty-dated WordPress affair and I wanted to start publishing some of the tools I've built for myself over the past few years. I'll be adding them in the near future."
