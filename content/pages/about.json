I love working as a contractor for many reasons but it's nice to have a constant stream of new challenges and a rich history of projects from which to draw experience.\n\n### Key Achievements\n\nDiagnosed and fixed an issue for Booking.com that was costing £1.8MM/yr in unnecessary outbound calls.\n\nSetup an abandoned cart email marketing system for an e-commerce client that has recovered over £1 million in lost revenue.\n\nEliminated a high volume of inbound telephone and email enquiries for Marriage Care by creating a book and pay system.\n\nSetup version control and a continuous delivery on the Dyno Rod and the National Audit Office projects.\n\nCreated a system that allowed the rapid deployment 22 of country-level microsites for the British Council helping their Digital team to get their main project back on schedule.\n\nSetup donations facility for local charity bringing in an extra £6K/yr in one-time donations and £12K/yr in regular donations.\n\nRecovered multiple hacked websites with no loss of data, helping their owners to understand why they’d been hacked and how to avoid the same fate in the future.\n\nPart of the team that built and deployed the Cars.booking.com white label for Rentalcars now generates approx 20% of all Rentalcars revenue.\n\nIncreased user engagement in Betfred’s mobile app by adding live stats to in-play events.\n\n### Need More Information?\n\n[Find me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnpeden/ \"John Peden on LinkedIn\")\n\n[Check out my podcast](https://podcast.tweakdigital.co.uk/ \"The Tweak Digital Podcast\")",
